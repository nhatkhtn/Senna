## Highlights

* Senna is an autonomous driving system that integrates a Large Vision-Language Model with an end-to-end model to improve planning safety, robustness and generalization.

* Senna achieves SOTA planning performance and demonstrates strong cross-scenario generalization and transferability.

## Getting Started
### Installtion
```shell
git clone git@github.com:hustvl/Senna.git
conda create -n senna python=3.10 -y
conda activate senna
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Preparation
We provide a [script](https://github.com/hustvl/Senna/blob/main/data_tools/senna_nusc_data_converter.py) for generating QA data required for Senna training. The script uses [LLaVA-v1.6-34b](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/llava-v1.6-34b) as the model for generating scene descriptions and planning explanations. You can run the script as follows:
```shell
sh data_tools/senna_nusc_converter.sh
```

### Weights

| Method | Model Size | Base LLM | Input View | Token per Image | Download |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |  :---: | :---: |
| Senna | 7B | vicuna-7b-v1.5 | 6 View | 128 | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/rb93dett/Senna) |


### Training
For Stage-1 Mix Pre-training:
```shell
sh train_tools/pretrain_senna_llava.sh
```
For Stage-2 Driving Fine-tuning and Stage-3 Planning Fine-tuning (full-parameter fine-tuning):
```shell
sh train_tools/train_senna_llava.sh
```
For Stage-2 Driving Fine-tuning and Stage-3 Planning Fine-tuning (LoRA fine-tuning):
```shell
sh train_tools/train_senna_llava_lora.sh
```
In our experiments, we observed that full-parameter fine-tuning outperforms LoRA fine-tuning. Therefore, we recommend using full-parameter fine-tuning. However, if your machine has limited GPU memory (e.g., only 24GB), you may consider using LoRA fine-tuning as an alternative.

### Evaluation
You can evaluate the accuracy of Senna meta-action planning using the script below.
```shell
sh eval_tools/senna_plan_cmd_eval_multi_img.sh
```

### Visualization
By running the visualization script below, you can overlay the predicted meta-actions and front-view scene descriptions onto the front-view image and save the results to the specified path.
```shell
sh eval_tools/senna_plan_visualization.sh
```
